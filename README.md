# Kitsos | Home Assistant 

This is my setup for the Home Assistant (configurations, automations & lovelace cards).
You can use any of them in your installation, just make sure to change any IP addresses, tokens, MAC addresses etc. with your own.

### How to use it

- In the **configurations** folder you'll find entries for your **configuration.yaml**
- In the **automations** folder you'll find entries for your **automations.yaml**
- In the **lovelace** folder you'll find entries for your **Lovelace UI**

Just copy & paste in the right file of your installation
